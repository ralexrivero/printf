.SH SYNOPSIS
#include "holberton.h"

int _printf(const char *format, ...)
.SH DESCRIPTION
produce output according to a format
write output to stdout, the standard output stream
Returns the number of characters printed
All of these functions write the output under the control of a
format string that specifies how subsequent arguments (or
arguments accessed via the variable-length argument facilities
are converted for output.
Format of the format string:
The format string is a character string, beginning and ending in
its initial shift state, if any.  The format string is composed
of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which
are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion
specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more
subsequent arguments.  Each conversion specification is
introduced by the character %, and ends with a conversion
specifier.  In between there may be (in this order) zero or more
flags, an optional minimum field width, an optional precision and
an optional length modifier.
